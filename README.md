🆘SafeAlert: Smart Emergency Reporting System
SafeAlert is a web-based emergency alert platform built during the Tech Innovation For Good Hackathon in just 24 hours.
The system allows users to quickly report emergencies while ensuring data security and administrative control for emergency response teams.

Inspiration
The idea for SafeAlert came after a personal experience — when my grandfather faced a sudden medical emergency.
That moment made me realize how crucial fast reporting and accurate verification are, and how often false alerts delay real help.
SafeAlert aims to lay the foundation for a smarter, more reliable emergency reporting network.
